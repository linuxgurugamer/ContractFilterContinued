Welcome to Contract Filter! This mod was created as a "more extensive" version of Rejector by SilverFox.  SilverFox has graciously allowed me to take the mod over.

What Contract Filter allows you as the user to do, is to configure how you want each type of contract to be when you accept it or reject it.

For example, if you need 60 science to get that next node, and you know there's going to be contracts with a reward of 60 science, then you can click on the type of contract you want to receive, whether it's Part Testing, Collecting Science, ISRU contracts, Body Surveys, or Science Gatherings, then you scroll to the textbox for minScienceComplete and put that from 0 to 60. Now after you save that up, you can start sorting your contracts!

When it sorts the contracts, it'll check all the conditions of the contract to match all the numbers and letters you gave it. So since you had a minimum requirement of 60 science upon completion, all those little contracts with 12 science and 5 science go poof. But all the 60+ science ones stay :D

You can do this for funds, science, reputation, contract parameters, bodies, and strings!

If you don't like those pesky Part testing while flying over a planet contracts, it's simple! Just click on PartTest tab, then go to Blacklist Strings, then type into the box "flying over" (be careful, it's case sensitive!) and then add in the string to the blacklist. Save your settings, then start the sorting, and now all of those "flying over" contracts will vanish!

As another handy feature, you can just not get part test contracts at all! When you click on a contract type, just click the "Reject" button, and it will turn into an "Accept" button, letting you know that the type is now rejected, and you have the ability to accept the type again at any time.

WARNING: NOT SAVING YOUR SETTINGS CAN RESULT IN SETTINGS LOSS IF YOU CLOSE YOUR GAME, ALWAYS REMEMBER TO SAVE!
